## Running small examples via rustc
```bash
❯❯❯ rustc tuples.rs -o bin/tuples ; ./bin/tuples
Pair = (a, 17)
somechar=b, someint=19
right of (something_x_new) is _new
```

## Learning notes

- Basics :: `let`, simple data types, `tuples.rs`, functions, `blocks.rs`, `structs.rs`
- Patterns and Destructuring :: `patterns_destructure.rs`
