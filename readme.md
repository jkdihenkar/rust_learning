# RUST Learning

## Why learn RUST?
* Designed to be FAST and replace C++
* Memory Safety and more checks in compiler itself. 
    * Most of the concurrency and memory-safety bugs are eliminated at compile time. 
    * Memory safety in JAVA, PYTHON, JS comes at a performance cost and performance critical tools like WEB Browsers, Operating Systems, and similar performance critical apps cannot afford this cost. 
* Out-of-Box Cross Platform. With WASM the programs can be run in Web Browsers as well. 
* Not for Web in 2020. Growing in Embedded community. 
* Steep learning curve takes you to the depth of the basics of Memory Management and core CS features.
